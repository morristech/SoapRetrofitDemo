# SoapRetrofitDemo
A simple demonstration of using SOAP services with Retrofit.

The example app uses the service API at ![http://holidaywebservice.com/](http://holidaywebservice.com/).  

The app shows a calendar with all the holidays in United States highlighted. And on tapping any holiday, it shows its more details about that day.
